# introduction
This is a converter that takes Pythonic pseudocode and turns it into ternary statements.
It leverages stack-based DFS to convert basic if-else statements into prettified ternary operators.
This program can also handle basic comments, in case you want to annotate some lines of codes into ternary logic as well.

# usage
Download ternary.py locally, and have a well-formed if-else pseudocode in a file called 'input.txt'.
Run ternary.py (using 'python ternary.py' or 'python3 ternary.py') in the terminal.
It should produce a file called 'output.txt' with your ternary logic with proper code style and indentation.

# examples
An example for what a well-formed 'input.txt' and the resulting 'output.txt' produced is included in this repo.
